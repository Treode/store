# Functions common to the various build scripts.

# Exit the shell if the actual exit status of the most recent command is not the expected value.
# If an error occurs, echo a message to both $LOG and STDOUT. The default expected value is 0, as 
# most command line utilities exit with status zero on success. A handful of commands do something
# different.
#
# Usage:
#     expect-status [expected] [message]
expect-status() {
  local status=$?
  local log=${LOG:-"build.log"}
  local expected=${1:-0}
  local message=${2:-"Failed"}
  if [ $status -ne $expected ] ; then
    echo $message
    echo $message >> $log
    exit 1
  fi
}

# Echo the command to $LOG and STDOUT, and then do it. If the command exits with a non-zero status
# exit this shell.
#
# This is somewhat like supplying the `-xe` options to bash. However, the `-x` option for bash is
# too noisy for the regular build, and we do not want the `-e` option applied to every command.
#
# Usage:
#    echo-do command args...
echo-do() {
  local log=${LOG:-"build.log"}
  echo $*
  echo $* >> $log
  $* >> $log
  expect-status 0 "$1 failed"
}

# Echo a message to $LOG and STDOUT.
#
# Usage:
#     log message...
log() {
  local log=${LOG:-"build.log"}
  echo $*
  echo $* >> $log
}
