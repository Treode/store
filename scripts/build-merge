# Build, test and package before merging into the master branch.
#
# This script works with the Jenkins service. Jenkins triggers the build whenever there is a push
# on a merge branch (that is a branch named 'merge/*'). It runs this script, and if it is
# successful, then Jenkins merges the change into the master branch. This script produces a .tgz
# file containing all files that need to be put on oss.treode.com.
#
# Specifically, this script
# 1) Builds and tests the libraries for the Treode store.
# 2) Publishes those libraries locally.
# 3) Builds and tests the examples using the locally published libraries.
# 4) Builds the Scala docs.
# 5) Stages everything for the .tgz file, and then packages it.
#
# Actually putting the files on oss.treode.com requires a password, so that has been left for a
# person.
