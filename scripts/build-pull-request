# Build and test a pull request.
#
# This script works with the Jenkins service. Jenkins triggers the build whenever there is a new
# pull request on GitHub, or a change on an existing pull request. Jenkins runs this script, and
# then it marks the pull request with success/failure.
#
# Specifically, this script
# 1) Builds and tests the libraries for the Treode store.
# 2) Publishes those libraries locally.
# 3) Builds and tests the examples using the locally published libraries.
