/** How to read and write an object of a particular type.
  *
  * @define Frame
  * Allow four bytes for the length, and write `v` after that. Once `v` has been written, compute
  * its byte length and write that to the first four bytes. The length is that of the value only;
  * it does not include the length of itself. This starts writing the length at `writePos`, and it
  * leaves `writePos` at the end of `v`.
  *
  * @define FrameChecksum
  * Allow four bytes for the length, next allow space for the checksum, finally write `v` after
  * that. Once `v` has been written, compute its byte length and checksum, and write those at the
  * beginning. The length is that of the value only; it does not include the length of itself or
  * checksum. This starts writing the length and checksum at `writePos`, and it leaves `writePos`
  * at the end of `v`.
  *
  * @define MatedDeframe
  * The mated `deframe` method lives in [[com.treode.async.io.File File]] and
  * [[com.treode.async.io.Socket Socket]].
