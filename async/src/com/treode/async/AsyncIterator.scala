/** Iterate items asynchronously.
  *
  * Compare to [[BatchIterator]]. The `foreach` and `whilst` methods here take an asynchronous
  * function, whereas those methods in BatchIterator take a plain old function.
  *
  * You should consider using BatchIterator whenever possible. AsyncIterator places a task on the
  * scheduler foreach element, and that can adds overhead. If you must do some asynchronous task
  * for every element, you will incur that overhead anyway, so the point is moot, and this
  * interface will be more convenient. On the other hand, if you can do that asynchronous task for
  * a batch of items, you can save that overhead by using BatchIterator.
